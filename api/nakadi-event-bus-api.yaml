  title: Nakadi Event Bus API Definition
  description: |

    Nakadi at its core aims at being a generic and content-agnostic event broker with a convenient
    API.  In doing this, Nakadi abstracts away, as much as possible, details of the backing
    messaging infrastructure. The single currently supported messaging infrastructure is Kafka
    (Kinesis is planned for the future).

    In Nakadi every Event has an EventType, and a **stream** of Events is exposed for each
    registered EventType.

    An EventType defines properties relevant for the operation of its associated stream, namely:

    * The **schema** of the Event of this EventType. The schema defines the accepted format of
    Events of an EventType and will be, if so desired, enforced by Nakadi. Usually Nakadi will
    respect the schema for the EventTypes in accordance to how an owning Application defines them.

    * The expected **validation** and **enrichment** procedures upon reception of an Event.
    Validation define conditions for the acceptance of the incoming Event and are strictly enforced
    by Nakadi. Usually the validation will enforce compliance of the payload (or part of it) with
    the defined schema of its EventType. Enrichment specify properties that are added to the payload
    (body) of the Event before persisting it. Usually enrichment affects the metadata of an Event
    but is not limited to.

    * The **ordering** expectations of Events in this stream. Each EventType will have its Events
    stored in an underlying logical stream (the Topic) that is physically organized in disjoint
    collections of strictly ordered Events (the Partition). The EventType defines the field that
    acts as evaluator of the ordering (that is, its partition key); this ordering is guaranteed by
    making Events whose partition key resolves to the same Partition (usually a hash function on its
    value) be persisted strictly ordered in a Partition.  In practice this means that all Events
    within a Partition have their relative order guaranteed: Events (of a same EventType) that are
    *about* a same data entity (that is, have the same value on its Partition key) reach always the
    same Partition, the relative ordering of them is secured. This mechanism implies that no
    statements can be made about the relative ordering of Events that are in different partitions.

    * The **authorization** rules for the event type. The rules define who can produce events for
    the event type (write), who can consume events from the event type (read), and who can update
    the event type properties (admin). If the authorization rules are absent, then the event type
    is open to all authenticated users.

    Except for defined enrichment rules, Nakadi will never manipulate the content of any Event.

    Clients of Nakadi can be grouped in 2 categories: **EventType owners** and **Clients** (clients
    in turn are both **Producers** and **Consumers** of Events). Event Type owners interact with
    Nakadi via the **Schema Registry API** for the definition of EventTypes, while Clients via the
    streaming API for submission and reception of Events.

    A low level **Unmanaged API** is available, providing full control and responsibility of
    position tracking and partition resolution (and therefore ordering) to the Clients.

    In the **High Level API** the consumption of Events proceeds via the establishment
    of a named **Subscription** to an EventType. Subscriptions are persistent relationships from an
    Application (which might have several instances) and the stream of one or more EventType's,
    whose consumption tracking is managed by Nakadi, freeing Consumers from any responsibility in
    tracking of the current position on a Stream.


    Scope and status of the API
    ---------------------------------

    In this document, you'll find:

    * The Schema Registry API, including configuration possibilities for the Schema, Validation,
    Enrichment and Partitioning of Events, and their effects on reception of Events.

    * The existing event format (see definition of Event, BusinessEvent and DataChangeEvent)
    (Note: in the future this is planned to be configurable and not an inherent part of this API).

    * High Level API.

    Other aspects of the Event Bus are at this moment to be defined and otherwise specified, not included
    in this version of this specification.

        Creates a new `EventType`.

        The fields enrichment-strategies and partition-resolution-strategy
        have all an effect on the incoming Event of this EventType. For its impacts on the reception
        of events please consult the Event submission API methods.

        * Validation strategies define an array of validation stategies to be evaluated on reception
        of an `Event` of this `EventType`. Details of usage can be found in this external document

          - http://zalando.github.io/nakadi-manual/

        * Enrichment strategy. (todo: define this part of the API).

        * The schema of an `EventType` is defined as an `EventTypeSchema`. Currently only
        the value `json-schema` is supported, representing JSON Schema draft 04.

        Following conditions are enforced. Not meeting them will fail the request with the indicated
        status (details are provided in the Problem object):

        * EventType name on creation must be unique (or attempting to update an `EventType` with
          this method), otherwise the request is rejected with status 409 Conflict.

        * Using `EventTypeSchema.type` other than json-schema or passing a `EventTypeSchema.schema`
        that is invalid with respect to the schema's type. Rejects with 422 Unprocessable entity.

        * Referring any Enrichment or Partition strategies that do not exist or
        whose parametrization is deemed invalid. Rejects with 422 Unprocessable entity.

        Nakadi MIGHT impose necessary schema, validation and enrichment minimal configurations that
        MUST be followed by all EventTypes (examples include: validation rules to match the schema;
        enriching every Event with the reception date-type; adhering to a set of schema fields that
        are mandatory for all EventTypes). **The mechanism to set and inspect such rules is not
        defined at this time and might not be exposed in the API.**

        Publishes a batch of `Event`s of this `EventType`. All items must be of the EventType
        identified by `name`.

        Reception of Events will always respect the configuration of its `EventType` with respect to
        validation, enrichment and partition. The steps performed on reception of incoming message
        are:

        1. Every validation rule specified for the `EventType` will be checked in order against the
        incoming Events. Validation rules are evaluated in the order they are defined and the Event
        is **rejected** in the first case of failure. If the offending validation rule provides
        information about the violation it will be included in the `BatchItemResponse`.  If the
        `EventType` defines schema validation it will be performed at this moment. The size of each
        Event will also be validated. The maximum size per Event is 999,000 bytes. We use the batch
        input to measure the size of events, so unnecessary spaces, tabs, and carriage returns will
        count towards the event size.

        1. Once the validation succeeded, the content of the Event is updated according to the
        enrichment rules in the order the rules are defined in the `EventType`.  No preexisting
        value might be changed (even if added by an enrichment rule). Violations on this will force
        the immediate **rejection** of the Event. The invalid overwrite attempt will be included in
        the item's `BatchItemResponse` object.

        1. The incoming Event's relative ordering is evaluated according to the rule on the
        `EventType`. Failure to evaluate the rule will **reject** the Event.

        Given the batched nature of this operation, any violation on validation or failures on
        enrichment or partitioning will cause the whole batch to be rejected, i.e. none of its
        elements are pushed to the underlying broker.

        Failures on writing of specific partitions to the broker might influence other
        partitions. Failures at this stage will fail only the affected partitions.

        Starts a stream delivery for the specified partitions of the given EventType.

        The event stream is formatted as a sequence of `EventStreamBatch`es separated by `\n`. Each
        `EventStreamBatch` contains a chunk of Events and a `Cursor` pointing to the **end** of the
        chunk (i.e. last delivered Event). The cursor might specify the offset with the symbolic
        value `BEGIN`, which will open the stream starting from the oldest available offset in the
        partition.

        Currently the `application/x-json-stream` format is the only one supported by the system,
        but in the future other media types may be supported.

        If streaming for several distinct partitions, each one is an independent `EventStreamBatch`.

        The initialization of a stream can be parameterized in terms of size of each chunk, timeout
        for flushing each chunk, total amount of delivered Events and total time for the duration of
        the stream.

        Nakadi will keep a streaming connection open even if there are no events to be delivered. In
        this case the timeout for the flushing of each chunk will still apply and the
        `EventStreamBatch` will contain only the Cursor pointing to the same offset. This can be
        treated as a keep-alive control for some load balancers.

        The tracking of the current offset in the partitions and of which partitions is being read
        is in the responsibility of the client. No commits are needed.

            Assumes the offset on each cursor is not inclusive (i.e., first delivered Event is the
            **first one after** the one pointed to in the cursor).

            If the header is not present, the stream for all partitions defined for the EventType
            will start from the newest event available in the system at the moment of making this
            call.

            **Note:** we are not using query parameters for passing the cursors only because of the
            length limitations on the HTTP query. Another way to initiate this call would be the
            POST method with cursors passed in the method body. This approach can implemented in the
            future versions of this API.

              Note: It's not currently possible to shift cursors based on time. It's only possible to shift cursors

        Endpoint for committing offsets of the subscription. If there is uncommited data, and no commits happen
        for 60 seconds, then Nakadi will consider the client to be gone, and will close the connection. As long
        as no events are sent, the client does not need to commit.

        If the connection is closed, the client has 60 seconds to commit the events it received, from the moment
        they were sent. After that, the connection will be considered closed, and it will not be possible to do
        commit with that `X-Nakadi-StreamId` anymore.

        When a batch is committed that also automatically commits all previous batches that were
        sent in a stream for this partition.

        Starts a new stream for reading events from this subscription. The data will be automatically rebalanced
        between streams of one subscription. The minimal consumption unit is a partition, so it is possible to start as
        many streams as the total number of partitions in event-types of this subscription. The rebalance currently
        only operates with the number of partitions so the amount of data in event-types/partitions is not considered
        during autorebalance.
        The position of the consumption is managed by Nakadi. The client is required to commit the cursors he gets in
        a stream.

        Lists all of the partition resolution strategies supported by this installation of Nakadi.
        Special or custom strategies besides the defaults will be listed here.

        Nakadi currently offers these inbuilt strategies:

        - `random`: Resolution of the target partition happens randomly (events are evenly
          distributed on the topic's partitions).

        - `user_defined`: Target partition is defined by the client. As long as the indicated
          partition exists, Event assignment will respect this value. Correctness of the relative
          ordering of events is under the responsibility of the Producer.  Requires that the client
          provides the target partition on `metadata.partition` (See `EventMetadata`). Failure to do
          so will reject the publishing of the Event.

        - `hash`: Resolution of the partition follows the computation of a hash from the value of
          the fields indicated in the EventType's `partition_key_fields`, guaranteeing that Events
          with same values on those fields end in the same partition. Given the event type's category
          is DataChangeEvent, field path is considered relative to "data".

  Event:
    type: object
    description: |
      **Note** The Event definition will be externalized in future versions of this document.

      A basic payload of an Event. The actual schema is dependent on the information configured for
      the EventType, as is its enforcement (see POST /event-types). Setting of metadata properties
      are dependent on the configured enrichment as well.

      For explanation on default configurations of validation and enrichment, see documentation of
      `EventType.category`.

      For concrete examples of what will be enforced by Nakadi see the objects BusinessEvent and
      DataChangeEvent below.

  EventMetadata:
    type: object
    description: |
      Metadata for this Event.

      Contains commons fields for both Business and DataChange Events. Most are enriched by Nakadi
      upon reception, but they in general MIGHT be set by the client.
    properties:
      eid:
        description: |
          Identifier of this Event.

          Clients MUST generate this value and it SHOULD be guaranteed to be unique from the
          perspective of the producer. Consumers MIGHT use this value to assert uniqueness of
          reception of the Event.
        type: string
        format: uuid
        example: '105a76d8-db49-4144-ace7-e683e8f4ba46'
      event_type:
        description: |
          The EventType of this Event. This is enriched by Nakadi on reception of the Event
          based on the endpoint where the Producer sent the Event to.

          If provided MUST match the endpoint. Failure to do so will cause rejection of the
          Event.

          This value can be used to construct a cursor when opening streams (see
          `GET /event-type/{name}/events` for details).

          Might assume the special name BEGIN, meaning a pointer to the offset of the oldest
          available event in the partition.

            description: |
              This number is a modifier for the offset. It moves the cursor forward or backwards by the number of events
              provided.
              For example, suppose a user wants to read events starting 100 positions before offset
              "001-000D-0000000000000009A8", it's possible to specify `shift` with -100 and Nakadi will make the
              necessary calculations to move the cursor backwards relatively to the given `offset`.

              Users should use this feature only for debugging purposes. Users should favor using cursors provided in
              batches when streaming from Nakadi. Navigating in the stream using shifts is provided only for

      pointing to the offset of the last Event in the stream.

      The size of the array of Event is limited by the parameters used to initialize a Stream.

      If acting as a keep alive message (see `GET /event-type/{name}/events`) the events array will
      be omitted.

  Subscription:
    description: |
      Subscription is a high level consumption unit. Subscriptions allow applications to easily scale the
      number of clients by managing consumed event offsets and distributing load between instances.
      The key properties that identify subscription are 'owning_application', 'event_types' and 'consumer_group'.
      It's not possible to have two different subscriptions with these properties being the same.

          The order is not important. Subscriptions that differ only by the order of EventTypes will be
          considered the same and will have the same id. The size of event_types list is limited by total number
          of partitions within these event types. Default limit for partition count is 100.

          Name of this EventType. The name is constrained by a regular expression.

          Note: the name can encode the owner/responsible for this EventType and ideally should
          follow a common pattern that makes it easy to read and understand, but this level of
          structure is not enforced. For example a team name and data type can be used such as
          'acme-team.price-change'.
        pattern: '[a-zA-Z][-0-9a-zA-Z_]*(\.[a-zA-Z][-0-9a-zA-Z_]*)*'

      owning_application:
        type: string
        description: |
          Indicator of the (Stups) Application owning this `EventType`.

      category:
        type: string
        enum:

          - data
          - business
        description: |
          Defines the category of this EventType.

          The value set will influence, if not set otherwise, the default set of
          validations, enrichment-strategies, and the effective schema for validation in
          the following way:

          - `undefined`: No predefined changes apply. The effective schema for the validation is
            exactly the same as the `EventTypeSchema`.

          - `data`: Events of this category will be DataChangeEvents. The effective schema during
            the validation contains `metadata`, and adds fields `data_op` and `data_type`. The
            passed EventTypeSchema defines the schema of `data`.

          - `business`: Events of this category will be BusinessEvents. The effective schema for
            validation contains `metadata` and any additionally defined properties passed in the
            `EventTypeSchema` directly on top level of the Event. If name conflicts arise, creation
            of this EventType will be rejected.

      enrichment_strategies:
        description: |
          Determines the enrichment to be performed on an Event upon reception. Enrichment is
          performed once upon reception (and after validation) of an Event and is only possible on
          fields that are not defined on the incoming Event.

          For event types in categories 'business' or 'data' it's mandatory to use
          metadata_enrichment strategy. For 'undefined' event types it's not possible to use this
          strategy, since metadata field is not required.

          See documentation for the write operation for details on behaviour in case of unsuccessful
          enrichment.

      compatibility_mode:
        description: |
          Compatibility mode provides a mean for event owners to evolve their schema, given changes respect the
          semantics defined by this field.

          It's designed to be flexible enough so that producers can evolve their schemas while not
          inadvertently breaking existent consumers.

          Once defined, the compatibility mode is fixed, since otherwise it would break a predefined contract,
          declared by the producer.

          List of compatibility modes:

          - 'compatible': Consumers can reliably parse events produced under different versions. Every event published
            since the first version is still valid based on the newest schema. When in compatible mode, it's allowed to
            add new optional properties and definitions to an existing schema, but no other changes are allowed.
            Under this mode, the following json-schema attributes are not supported: `not`, `patternProperties`,
            `additionalProperties` and `additionalItems`. When validating events, additional properties is `false`.

          - 'forward': Compatible schema changes are allowed. It's possible to use the full json schema specification
            for defining schemas. Consumers of forward compatible event types can safely read events tagged with the
            latest schema version as long as they follow the robustness principle.

          - 'none': Any schema modification is accepted, even if it might break existing producers or consumers. When
            validating events, no additional properties are accepted unless explicitly stated in the schema.

  title: Nakadi Event Bus API Definition
  description: |
    -----------
    Definitions
    -----------
    Nakadi at its core aims at being a generic and content-agnostic event broker with a convenient
    API.  In doing this, Nakadi abstracts away, as much as possible, details of the backing
    messaging infrastructure. The single currently supported messaging infrastructure is Kafka
    (Kinesis is planned for the future).

    In Nakadi every Event has an EventType, and a **stream** of Events is exposed for each
    registered EventType.

    An EventType defines properties relevant for the operation of its associated stream, namely:

    * The **schema** of the Event of this EventType. The schema defines the accepted format of
    Events of an EventType and will be, if so desired, enforced by Nakadi. Usually Nakadi will
    respect the schema for the EventTypes in accordance to how an owning Application defines them.
    **Note:** *Currently the specification of the schema must be pushed into Nakadi on EventType
    creation; in the future, assuming that Applications will expose the schema for its owned
    resources, Nakadi might support fetching the schema directly from them.*

    * The expected **validation** and **enrichment** procedures upon reception of an Event.
    Validation define conditions for the acceptance of the incoming Event and are strictly enforced
    by Nakadi. Usually the validation will enforce compliance of the payload (or part of it) with
    the defined schema of its EventType. Enrichment specify properties that are added to the payload
    (body) of the Event before persisting it. Usually enrichment affects the metadata of an Event
    but is not limited to.

    * The **ordering** expectations of Events in this stream. Each EventType will have its Events
    stored in an underlying logical stream (the Topic) that is physically organized in disjoint
    collections of strictly ordered Events (the Partition). The EventType defines the field that
    acts as evaluator of the ordering (that is, its partition key); this ordering is guaranteed by
    making Events whose partition key resolves to the same Partition (usually a hash function on its
    value) be persisted strictly ordered in a Partition.  In practice this means that all Events
    within a Partition have their relative order guaranteed: Events (of a same EventType) that are
    *about* a same data entity (that is, have the same value on its Partition key) reach always the
    same Partition, the relative ordering of them is secured. This mechanism implies that no
    statements can be made about the relative ordering of Events that are in different partitions.

    Except for defined enrichment rules, Nakadi will never manipulate the content of any Event.

    Clients of Nakadi can be grouped in 2 categories: **EventType owners** and **Clients** (clients
    in turn are both **Producers** and **Consumers** of Events). Event Type owners interact with
    Nakadi via the **Schema Registry API** for the definition of EventTypes, while Clients via the
    streaming API for submission and reception of Events.

    A low level **Unmanaged API** is available, providing full control and responsibility of
    position tracking and partition resolution (and therefore ordering) to the Clients.

    In the high level **Subscription API** the consumption of Events proceeds via the establishment
    of a named **Subscription** to an EventType. Subscriptions are persistent relationships from an
    Application (which might have several instances) and the stream of one or more EventType's,
    whose consumption tracking is managed by Nakadi, freeing Consumers from any responsibility in
    tracking of the current position on a Stream.

    **Note** *Currently the high level API is out of scope in this specification.  It is in the
    short term plan to be included.*


    Scope and status of this document
    ---------------------------------

    The present API specification is in **draft** state and is subject to change.

    In this document, ready for review are included:
    * The Schema Registry API, including configuration possibilities for the Schema, Validation,
    Enrichment and Partitioning of Events, and their effects on reception of Events.

    * The stantardised event format (see definition of Event, BusinessEvent and DataChangeEvent)
    (Note: at a later moment this will be configurable and not be inherent part of this API).

    * Unmanaged API (low level).

    Other aspects of the Event Bus are at this moment to be defined and otherwise specified, not
    included in this version of this specification.

    Notable omissions here are:

    * The contract between Nakadi and clients in the context of the high-level API (i.e. the process
    for clients to establish subscriptions).

    * Enrichment procedure.

    * Security scopes (OAuth) for the different operations

    * Explicit control of (in case of Kafka as underlying messaging broker) topic's creation
    parameters (number of partitions, retention times, etc), as well as their modification.

        Creates a new `EventType`.

        **Implementation note:** The creation of an EventType implicitly creates the structures in
        the backing messaging implementation needed for the reception and persistence of the
        Events. Considering that at this time only Kafka is used, this corresponds to the creation
        of a Topic. If so desired, clients can interact directly with the topic using the low level
        API (for existing restrictions see the corresponding methods on the topic-api).

        The fields validation-strategies, enrichment-strategies and partition-resolution-strategy
        have all an effect on the incoming Event of this EventType. For its impacts on the reception
        of events please consult the Event submission API methods.

        * Validation strategies define an array of validation stategies to be evaluated on reception
        of an `Event` of this `EventType`. Details of usage can be found in an external document
        (TBD link to document).

        * TBD Enrichment strategy

        * The schema of an `EventType` is defined as an `EventTypeSchema`. Currently only
        json-schema is supported.

        Following conditions are enforced. Not meeting them will fail the request with the indicated
        status (details are provided in the Problem object):

        * EventType name on creation must be unique (or attempting to update an `EventType` with
          this method), otherwise the request is rejected with status 409 Conflict.

        * Using `EventTypeSchema.type` other than json-schema or passing a `EventTypeSchema.schema`
        that is invalid with respect to the schema's type. Rejects with 422 Unprocessable entity.

        * Referring any of Validation, Enrichment or Partition strategies that does not exist or
        whose parametrization is deemed invalid. Rejects with 422 Unprocessable entity.

        Nakadi MIGHT impose necessary schema, validation and enrichment minimal configurations that
        MUST be followed by all EventTypes (examples include: validation rules to match the schema;
        enriching every Event with the reception date-type; adhering to a set of schema fields that
        are mandatory for all EventTypes). **The mechanism to set and inspect such rules is not
        defined at this time and might not be exposed in the API.**

        Publishes a batch of `Event`s of this `EventType`. All items must be of the EventType
        identified by `name`.

        Reception of Events will always respect the configuration of its `EventType` with respect to
        validation, enrichment and partition. The steps performed on reception of incoming message
        are:

        1. Every validation rule specified in the `EventType` will be checked in order against the
        incoming Events. Validation rules are evaluated in the order they are defined and the Event
        is **rejected** in the first case of failure. If the offending validation rule provides
        information about the violation it will be included in the `BatchItemResponse`.  If the
        `EventType` defines schema validation it will be performed at this moment.

        1. Once the validation succeeded, the content of the Event is updated according to the
        enrichment rules in the order the rules are defined in the `EventType`.  No preexisting
        value might be changed (even if added by an enrichment rule). Violations on this will force
        the immediate **rejection** of the Event. The invalid overwrite attempt will be included in
        the item's `BatchItemResponse` object.

        1. The incoming Event's relative ordering is evaluated according to the rule on the
        `EventType`. Failure to evaluate the rule will **reject** the Event.

        Given the batched nature of this operation, any violation on validation or failures on
        enrichment or partitioning will cause the whole batch to be rejected, i.e. none of its
        elements are pushed to the underlying broker.

        Failures on writing of specific partitions to the broker might influence other
        partitions. Failures at this stage will fail only the affected partitions.

        Starts a stream delivery for the specified partitions of the given EventType.

        The event stream is formatted as a sequence of `EventStreamBatch`es separated by `\n`. Each
        `EventStreamBatch` contains a chunk of Events and a `Cursor` pointing to the **end** of the
        chunk (i.e. last delivered Event). The cursor might specify the offset with the symbolic
        value `BEGIN`, which will open the stream starting from the oldest available offset in the
        partition.  Currently this format is the only one supported by the system, but in the future
        other MIME types will be supported (like `application/event-stream`).

        If streaming for several distinct partitions, each one is an independent `EventStreamBatch`.

        The initialization of a stream can be parameterized in terms of size of each chunk, timeout
        for flushing each chunk, total amount of delivered Events and total time for the duration of
        the stream.

        Nakadi will keep a streaming connection open even if there are no events to be delivered. In
        this case the timeout for the flushing of each chunk will still apply and the
        `EventStreamBatch` will contain only the Cursor pointing to the same offset. This can be
        treated as a keep-alive control for some load balancers.

        The tracking of the current offset in the partitions and of which partitions is being read
        is in the responsibility of the client. No commits are needed.

            If the header is not present, the stream for all partitions defined for the EventType
            will start from the newest event available in the system at the moment of making this

            **Note:** we are not using query parameters for passing the cursors only because of the
            length limitations on the HTTP query. Another way to initiate this call would be the
            POST method with cursors passed in the method body. This approach can implemented in the

        Lists all of the partition resolution strategies supported by this installation of Nakadi.

        If the EventType creation is to have a specific partition strategy (other than the default),
        one can consult over this method the available possibilities.

        Nakadi offers currently, out of the box, the following strategies:

        - `random`: Resolution of the target partition happens randomly (events are evenly
          distributed on the topic's partitions).

        - `user_defined`: Target partition is defined by the client. As long as the indicated
          partition exists, Event assignment will respect this value. Correctness of the relative
          ordering of events is under the responsibility of the Producer.  Requires that the client
          provides the target partition on `metadata.partition` (See `EventMetadata`). Failure to do
          so will reject the publishing of the Event.

        - `hash`: Resolution of the partition follows the computation of a hash from the value of
          the fields indicated in the EventType's `partition_key_fields`, guaranteeing that Events
          with same values on those fields end in the same partition.

        description: |
          Name of this EventType. Encodes the owner/responsible for this EventType.

          The name for the EventType SHOULD follow the pattern, but is not enforced
          'stups_owning_application.event-type', for example 'gizig.price-change'.

          The components of the name are:

          * Organization: the organizational unit where the team is located; can be omitted.

          * Team name: name of the team responsible for owning application; can be omitted.

          * Owning application: SHOULD match the field owning_application; indicates

          * EventType name: name of this EventType; SHOULD end in ChangeEvent for DataChangeEvents;
          MUST be in the past tense for BusinessEvents.

          (TBD: how to deal with organizational changes? Should be reflected on the name of the
          EventType?  Isn't it better to omit [organization:team] completely?)

          - business
        description: |
          Defines the category of this EventType.

          The value set will influence, if not set otherwise, the default set of
          validation-strategies, enrichment-strategies, and the effective schema for validation in
          the following way:

          - `undefined`: No predefined changes apply. The effective schema for the validation is
            exactly the same as the `EventTypeSchema`.  Default validation_strategy for this
            `EventType` is `['schema-validation']`.

          - `data`: Events of this category will be DataChangeEvents. The effective schema during
            the validation contains `metadata`, and adds fields `data_op` and `data_type`. The
            passed EventTypeSchema defines the schema of `data`.

          - `business`: Events of this category will be BusinessEvents. The effective schema for
            validation contains `metadata` and any additionally defined properties passed in the
            `EventTypeSchema` directly on top level of the Event. If name conflicts arise, creation
            of this EventType will be rejected.  Default validation_strategy for this `EventType` is
            `['schema-validation']`.

      validation_strategies:
        description: |
          Determines the validation that has to be executed upon reception of Events of this
          type. Events are rejected if any of the rules fail (see details of Problem response on the
          Event publishing methods).

          Rule evaluation order is the same as in this array.

          If not explicitly set, default value will respect the definition of the
          `EventType.category`.
        type: array
        items:
          type: string
        default: ['schema-validation']

      enrichment_strategies:
        description: |
          Determines the enrichment to be performed on an Event upon reception. Enrichment is
          performed once upon reception (and after validation) of an Event and is only possible on
          fields that are not defined on the incoming Event.

          For event types in categories 'business' or 'data' it's mandatory to use
          METADATA_ENRICHMENT strategy. For 'undefined' event types it's not possible to use this
          strategy, since metadata field is not required.

          See documentation for the write operation for details on behaviour in case of unsuccessful
          enrichment.

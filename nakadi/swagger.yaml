    API for nakadi operations
    =========================
    A few concepts in this working draft:
    * Stantardised event format (see #/definitions/Event);
    * Partition resolution: event store will infer the partition where a message needs to be set looking into the `partitioning_key` in the message body;
    * High level API should support automatic redistribution of the event streams during client topology changes.

        Post a single `Event` to the given `Topic`.

        Partition selection is done using the defined partition resolution. The partition resolution strategy is defined per topic and is managed by Nakadi (currently resolved from a hash over `ordering_key`).

        If explicit control over to which partition in a topic an event is being sent to is needed, a client is advised to use the low level api.

In this section we'll walk through running a Nakadi service on your machine.
Once you have the service up and running, you can jump to
[Using Nakadi](#using_producing-events) to see how produce and consume messages.

## Quickstart

You can run a Nakadi service locally using Docker. If you don't have Docker
installed, there are great instructions available on
[the Docker website](https://www.docker.com/).

### Running a Server

From the project's home directory you can install and start a Nakadi container
via the `gradlew` command:

```sh
./gradlew startNakadi
```

This will start a docker container for the Nakadi server and another container
with its PostgreSQL, Kafka and Zookeeper dependencies. You can read more about
the `gradlew` script in the [Building and Developing section](#developing)

### Stopping a Server

To stop the running Nakadi:

```sh
./gradlew stopNakadi
```

### Notes

If you're having trouble getting started, you might find an answer in the
[Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](#f-a-q) section of the documentation.

#### Ports

Some ports need to be available to run the service:

-  8080 for the API server
-  5432 for PostgreSQL
-  9092 for Kafka
-  2181 for Zookeeper

They allow the services to communicate with each other and should not be used
by other applications.

### Mac OS Docker Settings

Nakadi is tested to work with [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
v18.03.1-ce-mac65 on OSX 10.12.6 without additional configuration.

Nakadi can also run in Docker Toolbox for Mac. Check out differences between
Docker and Docker Toolbox [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/docker-toolbox/).

Since Docker Toolbox runs inside VirtualBox, you will want to expose
some ports first to allow Nakadi to access its dependencies:

```sh
docker-machine ssh default \
-L 9092:localhost:9092 \
-L 8080:localhost:8080 \
-L 5432:localhost:5432 \
-L 2181:localhost:2181
```

Alternatively you can set up port forwarding on the "default" machine through
its network settings in the VirtualBox UI.

If you get the message "Is the
docker daemon running on this host?" but you know Docker and VirtualBox are
running, you might want to run this command:

```sh
eval "$(docker-machine env default)"
```

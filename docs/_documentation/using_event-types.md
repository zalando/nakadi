## Event Types

The object containing the information describing an event is called an
_event type_.

To publish events an event type must exist in Nakadi. The event type
contains information such as its name, a category, the owning application,
strategies for partitioning and enriching data, and a
[JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/). Nakadi has an event type registry
API that lists all the available event types.

### Event Types and Categories

There are three main _categories_ of event type defined by Nakadi -

- **Business Event**: An event that is part of, or drives a business process, such as a state transition in a customer order.

- **Data Change Event**: An event that represents a change to a record or other item, or a new item. Change events are associated with a create, update, delete, or snapshot operation.

- **Undefined Event**: A free form category suitable for events that are entirely custom to the producer.

Each event category enables different capabilities for an event type, notably their schema and validation rules, which we'll describe next.

### Event Type Schema and Effective Schema

The events for the 'business' and 'data' categories have their own pre-defined
schema structures, based on JSON Schema, as well as a schema that is defined
custom to the event type when it is created. The pre-defined structures
describe common fields for an event and the custom schema for the event is
defined when the event type is created.  

The schema for an event type is submitted as a JSON Schema and will only declare the custom part of the event. This means the pre-defined schema for
the 'business' and 'data' categories don't need to be declared (and should not
be declared). The 'undefined' category has no-predefined schema.

When an event for one of these categories is posted to the server, it is
expected to conform to the _combination_ of the pre-defined schema and to the
custom schema defined for the event type, and not just the custom part of the event. This combination is called the _effective schema_ and is validated by Nakadi for the 'business' and 'data' types.

The 'undefined` category behaves slightly different to the other categories. Its effective schema is exactly the same as the one created with its event type definition (it has no extra structure), but it is **not** validated by Nakadi. Instead an 'undefined' event type's schema is simply made available in the event type registry for consumers to use if they wish.

The custom schema for an event type can be as simple as
`{ "\additionalProperties\": true }` to allow arbitrary JSON, but will usually
have a more specific definition :)

### Compatibility modes

Compatibility modes are used to control schema changes. Each mode
solves a specific problem and thus presents different constraints.

Nakadi supports different compatibility modes for event types used to
control valid schema changes and to ensure schema consistency of
published event data. Compatibility modes define restrictions for
event schema evolution, i.e. a set cascade of allowed schema changes
and thereby different compatibility guarantees for event consumers.

The default compatibility mode is `forward` compatible, but full
compatibility usage is definitely encouraged, and the default mode
will change in near future.

#### Fully compatible

The `compatible` compatibility mode is the safest mode. It's both
forward compatible and backward compatible. It means that:

1. Consumers using older schemas can safely read events validated by
   newer schemas.
2. Consumers using newer schemas can safely read events validated by
   older schemas.

It guarantees high data quality, which is crucial for a variety of
applications. At Zalando, it's required to use this compatibility mode
to have data processed by business intelligence and long term event
storage by the data lake.

Supported changes:

1. changes to meta attributes: titles and descriptions.
2. addition of new optional attributes.

The following json-schema attributes are not supported:

- additionalProperties
- additionalItems
- not
- patternProperties

Removing the support for these attributes is necessary to avoid the
introduction of incompatible changes.

Under this compatibility mode, it's necessary to fully specify events
properties in order for validation to succeed; events containing
properties that are not declared in the schema will be rejected. For
this reason, producers should first update their schemas with new
attributes and only after that start producing events with such
attributes.

#### Forward compatible

The `forward` mode has been designed to allow event type owners to
expand their schemas without breaking existing consumers.

It's called forward because consumers using older schemas can safely
read events generated by newer schemas. However, it's not backward
compatible, in the sense that reading older events using newer schemas
is not safe.

Supported changes:

1. changes to meta attributes: titles and descriptions.
2. addition of new optional attributes.
3. marking attributes as required.
4. change additionalProperties from true to object.

Under this mode event validation accepts events with fields not
declared in the schema. In other words, it's not necessary to specify
`additionalProperties true` in the schema, since this is the default
behaviour of json-schema validator.

We discourage the usage of `additionalProperties` entirely. The more
complete a schema definition the more stable and valuable the
events. The ability to not specify every attribute is there only for
some very specific situations when it's not possible to define them
all.

Consumers reading events from forward compatible event types SHOULD
ignore event attributes not declared in the event type schema. This is
aligned with
[API guidelines for compatibility](https://zalando.github.io/restful-api-guidelines/compatibility/Compatibility.html).

#### Incompatible

Under compatibility mode `none` schemas can be changed
arbitrarily. This mode is not recommended unless there is a very good
reason not to provide any compatibility guarantee.

#### Changing compatibility modes

It's possible to change the compatibility mode from `none` to
`forward` and from `forward` to `compatible`, e.g. it's possible to
make the schema validation more strict but never more relaxed.

It's not possible to upgrade directly from `none` to
`compatible`. It's necessary to go first through `forward` for later
upgrading to `compatible`.

Users should be aware about changes in validation behaviour when
upgrading to `compatible`. Please, be sure to read the section on
`compatible` mode above.

### Creating an Event Type

An event type can be created by posting to the `/event-types` resource.

This example shows a `business` category event type called `order_received`:

```sh
curl -v -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/event-types -d '{
  "name": "order_received",
  "owning_application": "acme-order-service",
  "category": "business",
  "partition_strategy": "hash",
  "partition_key_fields": ["order_number"],
  "enrichment_strategies": ["metadata_enrichment"],
  "default_statistic": {
    "messages_per_minute": 1000,	
    "message_size":	5,
    "read_parallelism":	1,
    "write_parallelism": 1
  },
  "schema": {
    "type": "json_schema",
    "schema": "{ \"properties\": { \"order_number\": { \"type\": \"string\" } } }"
  }
}'
```

The event type has a simple JSON Schema submitted as an escaped JSON string describing the `order number` and thus only declare the custom part of the schema. The `partition_strategy`
says events will be allocated to partitions according to the hash of the `order_number` field, defined in `partition_key_fields`, and the owner's name is
`"acme-order-service"`. The `enrichment_strategies` array says to apply `metadata_enrichment` to submitted events (common metadata is a feature of some categories).

The event type has an optional `default_statistic` object, which controls the number of partitions. Nakadi will use a sensible default if no value is provided. The values provided here 
cannot be changed later, so choose them wisely. 

A successful request will result in a `201 Created` response.

Once an event type is created, it is added to the _event type registry_ and its details are visible from its URI in the registry. Events can then be posted to its stream and consumed by multiple clients.

The exact required fields depend on the event type's category, but `name`, `owning_application` and `schema` are always expected. The
["API Reference"](#nakadi-event-bus-api) contains more details on event types.

### Partitions

An event type's stream is divided into one or more _partitions_ and each event is placed into exactly one partition. Partitions preserve the order of events - once an event is added to a partition its position relative to other events in the partition is never changed. The details of the partitions and their offsets for an event type are available via its `/partitions` resource.

#### Partition Ordering

Each partition is a fully ordered log, and there is no global ordering across partitions. Clients can consume a stream's partitions independently and track their position across the stream.

Dividing a stream this way allows the overall system to be scaled and provide
good throughput for producers and consumers. It's similar to how systems such as [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#intro_topics) and AWS Kinesis work.

#### Partition Strategies

The assignment of events to a partition is controllable by the producer. The
`partition_strategy` field determines how events are mapped to partitions. Nakadi offers the following strategies:

- `random`: the partition is selected randomly and events will be evenly distributed across partitions. Random is the default option used by Nakadi.

- `hash`: the partition is selected by hashing the value of the fields
  defined in the event type's `partition_key_fields`. In practice this means events that are about the same logical entity and which have the same values for the partition key will be sent to the same partition.

- `user_defined`: the partition is set by the producer when sending an event. This option is only available for the 'business' and data' categories.

Which option to use depends on your requirements. When order matters, hash is usually the right choice. For very high volume streams where order doesn't matter, random can be a good choice as it load balances data well. The user defined option is a power tool, unless you know you need it, use hash or random. Hash is the preferred strategy, as it ensures that duplicated events will end up in the same partition.

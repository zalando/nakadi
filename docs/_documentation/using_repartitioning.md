## Repartitioning

Throughput of event type is defined by default statistic, which basically sets number of partitions for the event
 type (although it does not represent it clearly). Number of partitions is a scaling unit for Nakadi publishing and
  consumption. In order to change number of partitions one have to perform the following call, which you can read
   about in the ["API Reference"](#nakadi-event-bus-api). At the moment the request can be performed only by Nakadi
    admins.
```sh
curl -v -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/event-types/order_received/partition-count -d '[
{
    "partition_count": 3
}


HTTP/1.1 204 OK
```

### Important caveats

- Publishing events to event type with hash partition strategy will change the partitions in which they were appearing
 before
- Nakadi guarantees ordering per partition per batch, repartitioning event types from 1 partitions to more will break
 total order of events
- Repartitioning allows to only increase number of partitions
- Consuming subscriptions are disconnected once repartitioning is finished
